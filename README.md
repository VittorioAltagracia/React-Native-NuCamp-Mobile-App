# nucamp-react-native-project
This is my first React Native project that I am building as a part of React-Native course in Nucamp bootcamp

The project is complete, the only thing preventing me from deploying is that the data needs to be moved to a different server, currently the app fetches the data from a local JSON server.
And there are a few other things that need to be done since getting a mobile app live is more challenging than a web application.
